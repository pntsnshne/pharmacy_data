# pharmacy_data

This project is to show the fall of community/ independent pharmacies and the rise of retail chains.

Step 1: gather all pharmacy location history for state (starting with PA). Data is stored through the pals.pa.gov website and is aquired with the PA Pharmacy License python notebook. Result is csv.

Step 2: gather detailed information for each pharmacy from Step 1. Normally done through clicking on each individual pharmacy.
